## License

Code in this repo written by me is licensed under WTFPL. Third party library assets are marked with license headers. `card.html` and the CSS files in `templates` are either derived or directly copied from github.com, hence strictly speaking not licensed to me, but hopefully they don't mind my using their assets to generate derivative assets for use on their website. Generated images are under CC-0 if you must, but I doubt you want to display my cards.
